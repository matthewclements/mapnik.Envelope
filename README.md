mapnik.Envelope
===============

I'm attempting to make a map, zoomed in on a specific area. I'm using bbox = mapnik.Envelope(-55.2145,46.4852,-53.9291,47.441) and m.zoom_to_box(bbox) , but all I get is the background colour. If I just use m.zoom_all() it will display the whole map. If anyone could help me out on this I would really appreciate it, I'm very new to this. Thanks.
